Cell = a triangle
Three vertices in ccw order = vertex[0], vertex[1], vertex[2]
Three edges forming triangle = face[0], face[1], face[2] (What is the order ?)

Face = an edge
Vertices forming edge = vertex[0], vertex[1]
When you go from vertex[0] to vertex[1], 
   triangle to your left  = lcell
   vertex to your left    = lvertex
   triangle to your right = rcell
   vertex to your right   = rvertex
