convect.c

Solves linear advection eqn using upwind finite volume scheme, weno5 reconstruction and periodic bc.

We use PETSc vectors to manage parallelization but there is no matrix that is being solved.

To run:

make
mpirun -np 4 ./convect

Then plot solution in gnuplot

gnuplot> p "sol.dat" w lp
